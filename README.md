- A Good Looking James Bond Watchface that takes full advantage of the pebble's square face 
- Battery indicator at the bottom of the watch face
- Left bar depletes if your watch usage is draining your battery at a faster rate than the watch's advertised battery life (auto detects if you have 7 or 10 days expected battery life). This updates each time the battery life changes.

How it works... 
The bar represents a percentage (the 3 large portions represent 50%, and the 5 small portions represent 50%). 
The percentage showing of the entire bar represents the percentage that your watch's battery is lasting compared to the it's specifications.
If it is full it means you are getting the most out of your battery, if it is half-full it means you are getting half of the time you could be.

- Right bar will go empty if Bluetooth disconnects 
- Displays date and time 
- Displays weather 
- Select authentic or practical mode for display theme changes
- Pebble has given this an A grade for battery life
- Based on the Golden eye watch face 

- Heart if you like martini's!!!
